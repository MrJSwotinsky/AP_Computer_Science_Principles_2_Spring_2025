    <td><b>Examples of Phishing Attacks</b></td>
    <td>
    <b>Example 1/</b> You are browsing social media and come across a post offering a free gift card or a chance to win a prize in exchange for completing a survey. The survey asks for personal information, such as your full name, address, phone number, and even your date of birth or social security number.<br><br><b>Example 2/</b> You receive a text message that appears to be from your mobile phone carrier, alerting you about a supposed billing issue. The message claims that your latest payment failed and your account is at risk of being suspended. To avoid suspension, you are urged to click on a link and update your payment information immediately.<br><br><b>Example 3/</b> You receive an email claiming to be from your email provider (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook). It states that there's been suspicious activity on your account and you need to reset your password immediately to prevent unauthorized access. A prominent button or link urges you to "Reset Password Now".<br><br><b>Example 4/</b> You receive a phone call from someone claiming to be from your internet service provider, stating that there is a problem with your internet connection and they need remote access to your computer to fix it.  They also ask you to provide your account number before proceeding.<br><br><b>Example 5/</b> You receive a notification on your smartphone, seemingly from your bank, informing you about a new feature they've implemented that allows you to log in to your account using a facial recognition scan. To set up the new feature, you're prompted to scan your face.<br>

    <td><b>Examples of Scenarios that are NOT Phishing Attacks</b></td>
    <td>
    <b>Example 1/</b> A user posts a photo of their new driver's license on social media, excited about finally getting it. They don't realize that the photo clearly shows their full name, address, and driver's license number.  <br><br><i>This is not a phishing attack because the user posted their license voluntarily.  They weren't tricked into posting it.</i><br><br><b>Example 2/</b> A company's database is hacked, and consumer data, including names, addresses, and credit card information is stolen. <br><br><i>This is not a phishing attack because the consumers didn't give away their own data.  It was stolen.</i><br><br><b>Example 3/</b> An individual's email is hacked because their password was easy to guess.<br><br><i>This is not a phishing attack because even though the user created a password that was easy to guess, they didn't give it away.</i><br><br><b>Example 4/</b> A user unknowingly downloads a keylogger onto their computer through a malicious email attachment or software. The keylogger records every keystroke they make, including their usernames, passwords, and credit card details. This information is then sent to the attacker.<br><br><i>This is not a phishing attack because their information was accessed using a keylogger.  The user did not give it away.</i><br><br><b>Example 5/</b> A popular online gaming platform suddenly becomes unavailable because its servers are being deliberately flooded with a large amount of traffic to prevent users from being able to access the platform.<br><br><i>This is not a phishing attack because no personal information is being given away.
