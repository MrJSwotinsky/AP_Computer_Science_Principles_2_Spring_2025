    <td>
    <b>Example 1/</b> You are browsing social media and come across a post offering a free gift card or a chance to win a prize in exchange for completing a survey. The survey asks for personal information, such as your full name, address, phone number, and even your date of birth or social security number.<br><br><b>Example 2/</b> You receive a text message that appears to be from your mobile phone carrier, alerting you about a supposed billing issue. The message claims that your latest payment failed and your account is at risk of being suspended. To avoid suspension, you are urged to click on a link and update your payment information immediately.<br><br><b>Example 3/</b> You receive a phone call from someone claiming to be from your internet service provider, stating that there is a problem with your internet connection and they need remote access to your computer to fix it.  They also ask you to provide your account number before proceeding.<br>
